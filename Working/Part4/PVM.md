Releasing an installation of the N-Body solver to all users on the PVM would require a centralised installation being created in the shared file system of the PVM. Initially, dependencies would need to be added to the head node via sudo (nvc++ and environment modules). Initialise a directory in the shared directory for the N-Body solver, copy the source code files to it and compile them using appropriate compiler flags. 

Following compilation of the N-Body solver, it can either be manually added to each users PATH manually which makes it harder to manage as it is in each users environment. Alternatively, an environment module could be created in the shared directory which could be loaded by users which allows for easier dependency management and cleaner user environments. This environment module will then need to be added to the system PATH.

A MPI file will then be created which allows the program to be used by more than one CPU core at a time along with distributed memory. The file can allow nodes with higher performance to allow more processes to be allocated to them, and particular processes in the simulation could be binded to certain nodes. In the case of the N-Body simulation, the head node should take the I/O processes and GPU-accelerated nodes
